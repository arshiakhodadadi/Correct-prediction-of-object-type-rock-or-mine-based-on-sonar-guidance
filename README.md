# Correct-prediction-of-object-type-rock-or-mine-based-on-sonar-guidance
This project presents a machine learning model that classifies sonar signals into rocks or mines using 60 frequency-based features. It encompasses data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, offering a practical solution for underwater object detection in maritime and defense applications

About Dataset:
NAME: Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks

SUMMARY: This is the data set used by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study
of the classification of sonar signals using a neural network [1]. The
task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced
off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.
